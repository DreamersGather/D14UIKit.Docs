This repository maintains the development documentation of [D14UIKit](https://github.com/DreamersGather/D14UIKit) project.

## Build

First change to `documents`, and install dependencies:

```
> pip install sphinx
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make/Open the documentation (in the default browser):

```
> make [ html | open ]
```

## Edit

We have included `.vscode` directory in the repository, and thus it is recommended to use VS Code to edit the documentation. In addition, it is convenient to preview every page with **reStructuredText** extension installed in VS Code.

## About

The two Chinese characters "文档" (means documentation) in the logo are in 小篆 (a font called Small Seal Script). After unifying the six states, Emperor Qin Shi Huang implemented the policy of "书同文" (i.e. writing with the same script), and 小篆 was selected as the written script widely used throughout the country. As a special type of information, we believe that documentation is playing a role in unifying the existing knowledge of the related project.
