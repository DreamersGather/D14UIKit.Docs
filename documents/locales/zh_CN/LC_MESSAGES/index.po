"D14UIKit is a GUI development library, which supports C++ and Python "
"languages, for modern Windows platform. D14UIKit implements high-"
"performance graphics rendering based on DirectX, and its default "
"appearance adapts to the Fluent Design style introduced in Windows 10/11."
" Furthermore, the modern Dark Mode theme is integrated as a basic feature"
" in the library, which provides a seamless visual experience between the "
"D14UIKit based and the native applications. Benefitted from various UI "
"controls built in the library, it is easy for developers to build "
"exciting GUI applications on modern Windows platform."

"Started from XP version, several update iterations have been done on the "

"There is a UIKit module in `D14Engine "
"<https://github.com/DreamersGather/D14Engine>`__, which was originally "
"developed to build the GUI of ``D14Engine::Editor``. However, as the "
"project developed, we gradually discovered its potential as a high-"
"performance UI library. ``D14Engine::UIKit`` is developed with native "
"C++, and its architecture is designed for high-performance and "
"customization. In order to utilize the module flexibly, developers not "
"only need to have considerable C++ experience, but also need to have a "
"certain understanding of development technologies such as COM and DirectX"
" that are bound to the Windows platform. Extra knowledge about Modern "
"Rendering Pipeline is required if developers are going to improve its "
"performance furthermore."

"On the one hand, these characteristics of UIKit make it difficult to get "
"started easily. Even developers who are familiar with related "
"technologies may not hesitate to choose more user-friendly UI libraries "
"when building lightweight applications that do not require high-"

"provide the powerful features of UIKit to everyone in a simpler way at "
"the cost of a minimal performance loss. Therefore, D14UIKit was born. It "
"has been modified and improved based on ``D14Engine::UIKit``, and is a "
"wrapper of the latter."
