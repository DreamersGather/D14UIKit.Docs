"For Windows 7 and older versions, the option can be found in control "
"panel (high-DPI scaling is supported starting from Windows XP). In "
"general, 100% scaling is displayed in 96 dpi (192 dpi for 200% scaling "
"and so on). In terms of GUI appearance, as the scaling ratio increases, "
"the size of a UI control will increase, and bitmap images may become "
"blurry (while vector images keep sharp)."

"DPI stands for \"Dots Per Inch\". As we all known, \"Inch\" is a physical"
" unit of length. In similar, \"Dot\" is a virtual unit of length on "
"bitmap plane, and it can refer to a pixel on bitmap screen or an ink dot "
"on printing paper. Therefore, DPI is a bridge connecting the physical "
"world and the virtual screen. After determining the DPI, the number of "
"pixels occupied by a display-object can be calculated from its physical "
"size, and vice versa. For example, in 96 dpi, a 1 inch line would occupy "
"96 pixels on screen or 96 ink dots on paper."

"In fact, DPI is often used to describe the sensitivity of electronic "
"devices. For example, considering a 1000 dpi mouse, its cursor moves 1000"
" pixels on screen every time the related device moves 1 inch on physical "
"plane. In addition, on Windows platform, there is a concept called Device"
" Independent Pixel (DIP), which is easily confused with Dots Per Inch "
"(DPI). DIP is a pixel unit in logical space, and it is often mapped to "
"multiple pixels in physical space. Applying DIP coordinates provides "
"great convenience for GUI development, as Windows automatically converts "
"logical pixels into physical pixels according to different DPI settings, "
"which ensures the object can be displayed correctly on screens of "
"different sizes and resolutions."

"For example, a 100 dip line would occupy 100 physical pixels on a 96 dpi "
"screen, while on a 192 dpi screen it would occupy 100*(192/96)=200 "
"physical pixels. More details can be found in this `article`_ on MSDN, "
"where the content of Direct2D and hig-DPI is also helpful for "
"development."

"Note that the Windows operating system has a global scaling setting (as "
"shown in :ref:`d14uikit-tutorials-beginner-dpi_adaption-display_scale` "
"above). Additionally, there are individual scaling settings for each "
"application (right-click on the exe → Properties → Compatibility → Change"

"DPI through other system APIs (such as Win32 or certain Python packages) "
"and manually manage the relevant data, allowing users to choose the "
"actual DPI to use."
