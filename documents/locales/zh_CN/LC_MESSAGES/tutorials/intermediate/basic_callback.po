"Compared to concise callback function setting in Python, C++ developers "
"may have noticed that the strict typing of C++ makes it a bit "
"complicated. In order to write the corresponding callback function, we "
"have to refer to the function prototype to copy relevant parameters and "
"return value information. That is not elegant at all, and we provide a "
"better solution in D14UIKit: There is a help-header **Callback.h** for "
"C++ developers, which includes the signature-macros of built-in callback "
"functions, and helps simplify the process of setting callback functions "
"in C++:"

"In fact, in modern C++ standards (such as C++20), we can already use the "
